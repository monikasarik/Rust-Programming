ðŸ¦€ What is Rust?

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on speed, safety, and concurrency. It allows developers to write fast and reliable software without worrying about common bugs like memory leaks or data races. What makes Rust unique is its strong emphasis on memory safety without using a garbage collectorâ€”thanks to powerful features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.

Rust is used in a wide range of domains:

Operating Systems (e.g., Redox OS, parts of Windows and Linux)
Web development (using frameworks like Rocket and Actix-web)
Embedded systems and IoT devices
Game development (e.g., Bevy game engine)
Blockchain and security tools (e.g., Solana, crypto wallets)
Command-line tools (e.g., ripgrep, exa)
Machine Learning (with growing libraries and support)

Rust provides scalar types like integers (i8, u8, etc.), floating-point numbers (f32, f64), booleans (bool), and characters (char). It also includes compound types such as tuples, arrays, and vectors (Vec). The &str type is an immutable string slice, while String is a growable, heap-allocated string. Additionally, Rust has the Option type for values that may or may not be present (Some or None).
