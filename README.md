ü¶Ä What is Rust?

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on speed, safety, and concurrency. It allows developers to write fast and reliable software without worrying about common bugs like memory leaks or data races. What makes Rust unique is its strong emphasis on memory safety without using a garbage collector‚Äîthanks to powerful features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.

Rust is used in a wide range of domains:

Operating Systems (e.g., Redox OS, parts of Windows and Linux)
Web development (using frameworks like Rocket and Actix-web)
Embedded systems and IoT devices
Game development (e.g., Bevy game engine)
Blockchain and security tools (e.g., Solana, crypto wallets)
Command-line tools (e.g., ripgrep, exa)
Machine Learning (with growing libraries and support)

Rust provides scalar types like integers (i8, u8, etc.), floating-point numbers (f32, f64), booleans (bool), and characters (char). It also includes compound types such as tuples, arrays, and vectors (Vec). The &str type is an immutable string slice, while String is a growable, heap-allocated string. Additionally, Rust has the Option type for values that may or may not be present (Some or None).


üß†‚ú® Memory Management and Ownership in Rust

One of Rust‚Äôs superpowers is how it handles memory safety without a garbage collector. Unlike C/C++ (which can suffer from dangling pointers) or Java/Python (which rely on sometimes unpredictable garbage collectors), Rust introduces a unique concept called Ownership.

üîê Ownership is Rust‚Äôs philosophy for managing memory safely and efficiently at compile time, with no runtime overhead.

Here are the 3 core rules of Ownership:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Each value in Rust has a variable that‚Äôs its owner
2Ô∏è‚É£ There can only be one owner at a time
3Ô∏è‚É£ When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (memory is freed automatically)

üî• This eliminates common issues like:

Dangling pointers

Double frees

Memory leaks

Rust enforces strict rules at compile time, ensuring safety without sacrificing performance. No GC, no surprises ‚Äî just predictable, fast, and safe memory handling.
